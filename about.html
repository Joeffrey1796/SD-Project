      <h2>From Beans to Brew</h2>
      <p>
        At Coffee Haven, we believe that every cup tells a story. Our journey began with a simple dream — to create a place where people could enjoy handcrafted coffee made with passion and care. Inspired by local roasters and global coffee traditions, we blend artistry and sustainability in every brew.
      </p>

      <p>
        We source only the finest ethically grown beans, roasted to perfection to bring out rich, aromatic flavors. Whether you prefer your coffee bold or smooth, we have something crafted just for you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Step inside our café, take a sip, and feel at home — because at Coffee Haven, comfort is served with every cup.
